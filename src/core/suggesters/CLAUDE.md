# Suggesters - Search Provider Integration System

## [Preserved Section - Permanent Documentation]

### Suggester Architecture
The `suggesters/` directory implements a plugin-like system for integrating different search providers and keyword suggestion sources:

**Core Components:**
- `BaseSuggester`: Abstract base class defining the suggester interface
- `MetaSuggester`: Orchestrates multiple suggesters and aggregates results
- `LobidSuggester`: German National Library (DNB) API integration
- `SWBSuggester`: Southwest German Library Network integration
- `CatalogSuggester`: Local library catalog integration via SOAP/HTTP
- `CatalogFallbackSuggester`: Fallback implementation for catalog access

### Suggester Pattern Implementation
**Plugin Architecture:**
- All suggesters inherit from `BaseSuggester` for consistent interface
- `SuggesterType` enum defines available suggester types
- Factory pattern in `MetaSuggester` for dynamic suggester instantiation
- Configurable suggester selection (single provider or combined results)

**Key Design Features:**
- **Caching Strategy**: Each suggester implements local and remote caching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in throttling to respect API limits
- **Result Aggregation**: Intelligent merging and deduplication of results
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking requests with proper threading support

### Provider-Specific Details

**LobidSuggester:**
- Integrates with Lobid.org REST API
- Supports GND (Gemeinsame Normdatei) authority data
- Implements subject heading and classification lookup
- Provides DDC (Dewey Decimal Classification) support

**SWBSuggester:**
- Connects to Southwest German Library Network
- SOAP-based web service integration
- Bibliographic metadata enrichment
- Regional library catalog access

**CatalogSuggester:**
- Generic interface for local library catalogs
- Configurable SOAP/HTTP endpoints
- Token-based authentication support
- Customizable search and detail retrieval

### Data Models and Processing
- **Result Normalization**: Standardized output format across all providers
- **Metadata Extraction**: Consistent field mapping from diverse APIs
- **Quality Scoring**: Result ranking based on relevance and completeness
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent caching with TTL and invalidation strategies

## [Variable Section - Short-term Information]

### Recent Enhancements (Claude Generated)
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved exception management across all suggesters
2. **Caching Optimization**: Better cache hit rates and reduced API calls
3. **Result Processing**: Enhanced result normalization and deduplication
4. **Threading Safety**: Improved thread-safe operations for GUI integration

### Current Configuration
- **Default Providers**: Lobid, SWB, and local catalog when available
- **Cache TTL**: 24 hours for most results, 1 hour for real-time data
- **Rate Limits**: Respectful API usage with configurable delays
- **Fallback Strategy**: Automatic failover to available providers

### Development Notes
- All new suggester functions marked as "Claude Generated"
- Comprehensive logging implemented for debugging and monitoring
- Type hints maintained throughout for better IDE support

## [Instructions Block - Operator-Defined Tasks]

### Future Tasks
1. **ADD - Additional Providers**: Integrate more library systems (OCLC, local catalogs)
2. **ADD - Advanced Caching**: Implement redis/memcached for distributed caching
3. **ADD - Result Analytics**: Add scoring and relevance ranking improvements
4. **ADD - Provider Health Monitoring**: Implement automatic provider health checks

### Vision
- Create a comprehensive ecosystem of library and academic search providers
- Establish ALIMA as the go-to tool for bibliographic metadata aggregation
- Implement intelligent result fusion from multiple authoritative sources
- Provide real-time provider status and automatic failover capabilities
- Support for emerging library standards and protocols (GraphQL, JSON-LD, etc.)
