# UI - PyQt6 User Interface Layer

## [Preserved Section - Permanent Documentation]

### UI Architecture
The `src/ui/` directory implements the complete PyQt6-based graphical user interface for ALIMA:

**Main Components:**
- `MainWindow`: Central application window with tab management and menu system
- `ðŸ†• PipelineTab`: Vertical pipeline UI orchestrating complete ALIMA workflow
- `ðŸ†• GlobalStatusBar`: Unified status display for providers, cache, and pipeline progress
- `AbstractTab`: Primary text analysis interface with chunking workflow
- `SearchTab` (find_keywords.py): GND keyword search and browse interface
- `AnalysisReviewTab`: Analysis workflow review and result management (enhanced with auto-receive)
- `CrossrefTab`: DOI metadata lookup and Crossref integration
- `UBSearchTab`: University library search interface
- `ImageAnalysisTab`: AI-powered image analysis functionality

**Supporting Components:**
- `SettingsDialog`: Application configuration interface
- `PromptEditorDialog`: LLM prompt template editor
- `TableWidget`: Enhanced table displays for search results
- `Widgets`: Reusable UI components and utilities
- `Styles`: Centralized styling and theme management

### PyQt6 Design Patterns
**Signal/Slot Architecture:**
- Comprehensive event-driven communication
- Thread-safe UI updates via signals
- Proper separation of UI and business logic
- Real-time streaming text display

**Threading Integration:**
- QThread-based background processing
- Non-blocking LLM generation
- Progress tracking and cancellation support
- Thread-safe GUI updates

**Layout Management:**
- Responsive design with QSplitter components
- Dynamic UI resizing during streaming
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Adaptive tab management

### Key UI Features

**AbstractTab - Text Analysis:**
- Multi-step chunking workflow
- Real-time LLM streaming display
- Dynamic text area resizing
- Result history and navigation
- Integrated keyword extraction

**Search Interfaces:**
- Unified search across multiple providers
- Real-time result display
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Export functionality
- Cache management integration

**Analysis Review System:**
- JSON-based analysis import/export
- Step-by-step workflow navigation
- Result comparison and validation
- Data transfer between analysis stages

### Threading and Responsiveness
**Background Operations:**
- SearchWorker threads for non-blocking searches
- LLM generation threads with streaming
- File I/O operations in separate threads
- Progress tracking and user feedback

**UI Responsiveness:**
- Dynamic content updates during operations
- Proper cursor management (busy/normal states)
- Real-time progress indicators
- Graceful error handling and user notification
